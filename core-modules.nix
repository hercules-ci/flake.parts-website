              ## WARNING

              This module does NOT make _consuming_ an overlay easy. This module is intended for _creating_ overlays.
              While it is possible to consume the overlay created by this module using the `final` module argument, this is somewhat unconventional. Instead:

              - _Avoid_ overlays. Many flakes can do without them.
              - Initialize `pkgs` yourself:
                ```
                perSystem = { system, ... }: {
                  _module.args.pkgs = import inputs.nixpkgs {
                    inherit system;
                    overlays = [
                      inputs.foo.overlays.default
                      (final: prev: {
                        # ... things you really need to patch ...
                      })
                    ];
                    config = { };
                  };
                };
                ```

              ## Who this is for

              This module is for flake authors who need to provide a simple overlay in addition to the common flake attributes. It is not for users who want to consume an overlay.

              ## What it actually does

              This module overrides the `pkgs` module argument and provides the `final` module argument so that the `perSystem` module can be evaluated as an overlay. Attributes added by the overlay must be defined in `overlayAttrs`. The resulting overlay is defined in the `overlays.default` output.

              The resulting behavior tends to be not 100% idiomatic. A hand-written overlay would usually use `final` more often, but nonetheless it gets the job done for simple use cases; certainly the simple use cases where overlays aren't strictly necessary.

              ## The status of this module

              It has an unfortunate name and may be renamed. Alternatively, its functionality may be moved out of flake-parts, into some Nixpkgs module. Certainly until then, feel free to use the module if you understand what it does.

              Adds the `flakeModules` attribute and `flakeModule` alias.

            intro = ''
              This module provides a generic `modules` flake output attribute, that can host modules for any module system application.

              Furthermore, it adds basic type checking so that the modules can't be imported into the wrong [class](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/index.html#module-system-lib-evalModules-param-class) of configurations.
              For example, if a Home Manager module would be loaded into a NixOS configuration, that becomes a simple type error, instead of a complicated message about undeclared options.

              Example:

              ```nix
              { withSystem, ... }: {
                flake.modules.nixos.myPreferences = ./nixos/preferences.nix;
                flake.modules.nixos.myService = { pkgs, ... }: {
                  imports = [ ./nixos/services/myService.nix ];
                  services.myService.package =
                    withSystem pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform.system ({ config, ... }:
                      config.packages.default;
                    );
                };
              }
              ```
            '';
          };

        flake-parts-partitions =
          { ... }:
          {
            imports = [ commonExtras ];
            extraName = "partitions";
            intro = ''
              This module provides a performance optimization, and a way to reduce the size of the main `flake.lock` that is [currently](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/7730) getting copied into all consuming flakes' lock files, which bothers some users.

              The goals of this module are:

              - **Do not load irrelevant modules** when you evaluate an attribute of an already locked flake, it . If the flake was locked remotely, the sources for those dependencies would still have to be fetched.
                This is achieved by moving some `imports` and their related definitons into [`partitions.<name>.module`](#opt-partitions._name_.module) and defining [`partitionAttrs.<attr>`](#opt-partitionedAttrs) to point to that partition.

              - **Don't copy irrelevant lock entries** when you lock a flake that has the current flake as its input.
                This can be achieved by moving inputs into a subflake whose only responsibility is to provide the inputs, and then pointing [`partitions.<name>.extraInputsFlake`](#opt-partitions._name_.extraInputsFlake) to that subflake.

              ## Example

              Definitions in the `mkFlake` root module (or a direct import into it):

              ```nix
              partitionedAttrs.checks = "dev";
              partitionedAttrs.devShells = "dev";
              partitionedAttrs.herculesCI = "dev";
              partitions.dev.extraInputsFlake = ./dev;
              partitions.dev.module = { inputs, ... }: {
                imports = [
                  ./nix/development.nix
                  inputs.hercules-ci-effects.flakeModule
                  inputs.git-hooks-nix.flakeModule
                ];
              };
              ```

              `dev/flake.nix`:

              ```nix
              {
                description = "Private inputs for development purposes. These are used by the top level flake in the `dev` partition, but do not appear in consumers' lock files.";
                inputs = {
                  hercules-ci-effects.url = "github:hercules-ci/hercules-ci-effects";
                  git-hooks-nix.url = "github:cachix/git-hooks.nix";
                  # See https://github.com/ursi/get-flake/issues/4
                  git-hooks-nix.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "";
                };

                # This flake is only used for its inputs.
                outputs = { ... }: { };
              }
              ```

              ## Caveats

              - A module in a partition can affect options that are not exported with `partitionedAttrs`. This will have an effect that is only observable in the attributes that are exported with `partitionedAttrs`, and not in the other flake attributes. This could be useful or surprising.

              - A flake used in `extraInputsFlake` is a separate flake, which means that you may have to duplicate e.g. a `nixpkgs` input for the purpose of `follows`. We don't have a way to override flake inputs after the effect.

              ## Explanation

              `imports` must be loaded eagerly by the module system, because any module can affect the contents and shape of `config`.
              Declaring `imports = [ foo ];` is simply not enough to know the effects of `foo` without getting `foo`'s attributes.

              Fortunately this fundamental limitation only applies one "layer" at a time. Every submodule has its own set of modules or `imports` and that allows us to still load modules lazily, as long as we provide the means for those modules to affect the root (here: the flake) in a controlled way. That is what this module does. It loads the "optional" modules into a separate submodule, and provides an option to load parts of that (sub)module evaluation into the root.
